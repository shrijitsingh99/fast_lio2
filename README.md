## FAST-LIO
**FAST-LIO** (Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry) is a computationally efficient and robust LiDAR-inertial odometry package. It fuses LiDAR feature points with IMU data using a tightly-coupled iterated extended Kalman filter to allow robust navigation in fast-motion, noisy or cluttered environments where degeneration occurs. Our package address many key issues:
1. Fast iterated Kalman filter for odometry optimization;
2. Automaticaly initialized at most steady environments;
3. Parallel KD-Tree Search to decrease the computation;
